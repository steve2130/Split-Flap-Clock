# Split Flap Clock
I'm addicted to split flap display after accidently watching some Youtube videos. I want to make one for myself, however, choices in the market are either kinda crap or too expensive for a sucker like me.
So I try to make one.

So this flap clock is basically a clone of Solari Cifra 3 (the same company who made airports' flap boards). Instead of making a simple clock like Cifra 3, I decided to fuck myself up and make one that has different functions. Timer, Stopwatch, update time automatically with a NTP server, something like that. 

So basically you will see some fucked up CADs and some stupid code in the future. Hopefully I can actually make a workable clock.

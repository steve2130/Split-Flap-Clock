# Test
Here you can find some 2D drawing.  
  
    
If you want to build this version as a prototype like me, remember that this design is designed to build with 2mm thick cardboard.  
Flaps and the shell/outer structure should be made with cardboard.  
Black cardboard looks way better than other colors for me.  
  
  
Remember that this design is only for test.  
Polypropylene is recommended for making flaps.   
  
  
Check the 3D model to know what's happening here.

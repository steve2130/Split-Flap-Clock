# 2nd Design
So this design is *way* better than the previous version.  
Shout out to gregerw (https://github.com/gregerw/Split-flap-display) for his brillant idea on the structure. ~~I copied it~~  
However, it is going to cost more than the previous design. All the structure of this design is going to be 3D printed.  

  

## Component (Provisonal)  
Motor: 2x 28BYJ-48 (5V) *should be ok?*  
Hall effect sensor: 2x KY-003  
Controller: 1x Arduino Nano  
Power source: 2x 18650 in serial

Trying to control 2x 28BYJ-48 motor with 1x ULN2003. However, ULN2003 only have 7 in and out pins and I need 8. 74HC959 may be needed?

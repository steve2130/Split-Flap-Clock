# First design

__This design is abandoned.__ 

This design uses 3mm MDF as the main structure for the hour and minute module.  
I was trying to design a structure so that it can be easily made with a laser cutter.   
However, the design I made was not strong enough for holding the entire structure together. It involved a LOT of friction mounts.  
As the center axis will going to be 3D printed anyway, this design is scrapped and I ~~shamelessly copied~~ made another design.
